Pairs Trading (Cointegration and Spread Trading): Pairs trading involves finding two assets whose prices move in a correlated way, then trading the spread between them. In crypto, an example could be Bitcoin vs. Ethereum (which often trend together) or any two coins influenced by similar factors (e.g. two exchange tokens, two privacy coins, etc.). The idea is to go long one coin and short the other when their price relationship diverges abnormally, betting that they will converge back. Unlike outright trading, this is market-neutral – if the whole crypto market crashes, a long-short pair could be insulated (because both legs fall). The key is identifying pairs with a stable statistical relationship (ideally cointegration, meaning they share a long-term equilibrium)

. For instance, if historically 1 ETH is usually priced at 0.07–0.08 BTC, and suddenly ETH/BTC jumps to 0.1, a pairs trader might short ETH and go long BTC on the expectation the ratio falls back into line. Research confirms that cointegration-based pairs trading in crypto has been profitable. One study tested various methods (correlation, cointegration, etc.) on top coins in 2018–2019 and found that long-short crypto portfolios generated positive cumulative returns in most periods and consistently outperformed a long-only strategy

. This implies that arbitraging relative mispricings added value beyond just holding crypto, challenging the market’s efficiency

. To implement, one needs historical price data for candidate pairs, run statistical tests (like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for a stationary price spread

), and define trading rules (e.g. when the spread is >2 standard deviations from its mean, short the spread; exit when it reverts). Practical consideration: transaction costs and synchronization are critical – one must trade both legs near simultaneously. However, because crypto trades 24/7 with many pairs available, a dedicated script (or even manual monitoring with alerts) can be set up. Pairs trading can also be done intra-market (same exchange) or cross-exchange (buy on one exchange, sell on another if a price gap appears). For example, if BTC is $100 higher on Exchange A than Exchange B, a fast trader could short A and buy on B to lock in the spread. Such pure arbitrage windows are rare and short-lived now, but during high volatility or on smaller exchanges they can occur.
